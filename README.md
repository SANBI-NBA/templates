# Quarto templates for NBA website synthesis content

This repository contains the necessary files for NBA content contributors to set up and test their individual pages for the NBA website. It is not intended to function as a website. Therefore the overall website setup, such as the top and side navigation bars are not configured in \_quarto.yml.

> [!NOTE] The NBA website is meant to be the equivalent of the synthesis report. It is not a technical report equivalent. You can (and are encouraged to) link to that kind of technical report detail. The addition of references and links to supporting technical detail is a change from the previous synthesis report. However, do not try to include the technical report type detail into the NBA Quarto website documents.

### quarto-templates

This folder contains the necessary files and folder structures to set up a local working version of the NBA website pages that enables you to preview what the pages will look like when incorporated into the NBA website. It is set up so that you can install the folder anywhere on your computer, but do not move around files, or rename any folders, otherwise the html previews will not work.

For more detailed instructions, see the READMEs inside this folder.

### csv-templates

This folder contains recommended structure for input data files to be used with the [NBA graphs package](https://github.com/SANBI-NBA/nbaR).
