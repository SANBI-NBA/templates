# quarto-templates project

This project folder contains all the supporting files to enable individual contributors to the NBA website to preview what their pages will look like in html format. Do not move, rename or edit any of these files or folders, but remember to periodically check for the latest versions on the [SANBI-NBA GitHub repo](https://github.com/SANBI-NBA/templates/).

> [!TIP]

> When working on your Quarto pages in RStudio, always start by opening the `quarto-templates.Rproj` file in this folder, which ensures that relative file paths are working correctly.
